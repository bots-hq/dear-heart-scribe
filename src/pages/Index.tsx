            Every morning when I wake up, the first thought that crosses my mind is you. 
            Your smile, your laugh, the way you scrunch your nose when you're concentrating - 
            these little details have become the most precious parts of my world.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            I never believed in fairy tales until I met you. You've shown me that magic 
            exists in the simplest moments - in shared glances across a crowded room, 
            in the way you hold my hand, in the comfort of your presence beside me.
          </p>
          <p className="text-romantic font-semibold">
            You are my today and all of my tomorrows. âœ¨
